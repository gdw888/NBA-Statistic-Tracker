## Background
This system is designed to automate the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of basketball player statistics from unstructured web pages, specifically from player profiles on Basketball Reference. The goal is to capture raw data and enrich it with advanced analytics, such as performance trends and head-to-head statistics against specific teams. The target users are basketball analysts and enthusiasts who require detailed and digestible insights into player performances, which are currently only available through manual review of extensive game data.

## Requirements

### Must Have
- Real-time data extraction to ensure the system captures updates as soon as they occur on the source web pages.
- Automated daily extraction of basketball player statistics from the specified web pages to ensure data is up-to-date.
- Storage of raw extracted data in a structured database.
- Calculation and storage of basic derived analytics, initially focusing on average points per game in a separate analytics table.

### Should Have
- Implementation of a generic analytics engine that can easily integrate new types of analytics as they are developed, leveraging both the raw and derived data.

### Could Have
- Expansion to include additional statistics and analytics as user feedback is incorporated and new needs are identified.

### Won't Have
- Integration with other sports or player statistics outside of the designated basketball player profiles at this stage.

## Method
The ETL system will utilize Scrapy for efficient web scraping, Apache Airflow for workflow management, PySpark for processing and transforming data, and PostgreSQL for data storage. The system will be containerized using Docker to ensure portability and ease of deployment across different environments.

1. **Data Extraction**: Use Scrapy to scrape basketball statistics from the web, managed by Airflow tasks.
2. **Data Storage**: Store raw data in PostgreSQL and utilize it for further processing.
3. **Data Transformation**: Use PySpark to compute advanced analytics like average points per game.
4. **Deployment**: Employ Docker to containerize the components for consistency and scalability across development and production environments.

## Implementation
The implementation will proceed in stages, starting with environment setup, followed by the development and testing of individual components, integration, and final deployment.

1. **Environment Setup**: Complete installation of all required software and tools, and set up the initial project documentation and version control.
2. **Database and Docker Configuration**: Set up the PostgreSQL database and Docker containers for each component.
3. **Development of Extraction and Transformation Scripts**: Develop and test Scrapy spiders and PySpark scripts.
4. **Airflow Integration and System Testing**: Configure Airflow and test the complete workflow from data extraction to transformation and loading.
5. **Deployment and Operationalization**: Deploy the system to a production environment and perform initial system tuning and optimization.
